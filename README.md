## 📚 Project Summary

This repository contains projects developed for the **Data Structures** course.  
The main goal of the course is to teach **fundamental data structures**, their operations, and basic algorithms, helping students understand how to store, manage, and access data efficiently.

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with **core data structures**, algorithmic thinking, and C++ programming best practices.

## 🧠 What I Learned

This project strengthened my understanding of:

### 🔹 Arrays and Linked Lists
- Implementing basic operations like insertion, deletion, and traversal  
- Understanding memory allocation for arrays and dynamic lists  
- Singly vs doubly linked lists and their practical uses  

### 🔹 Stacks and Queues
- Implementing push, pop, enqueue, and dequeue operations  
- Using stacks and queues to solve problems efficiently  
- Understanding the difference between linear and circular queues  

### 🔹 Trees and Graphs
- Implementing binary trees and binary search trees (BSTs)  
- Traversals: in-order, pre-order, post-order, BFS, DFS  
- Representing graphs using adjacency lists and matrices  

### 🔹 Hash Tables
- Implementing insert, delete, and lookup operations  
- Understanding hash functions and collision handling techniques
